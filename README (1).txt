Technique 1: To run the programs, open the code on Google colab notebook and copy and paste the code over.
Once that is done, simply run the code, and the results should pop up on the screen.
Technique 2: If the user does not have access to Google colab notebook, copy and paste or open
the codes into a Python IDE like PyCharms by JetBrains and run the code on there and the results 
will pop up.
Technique 3: If the other options do not work, copy and paste or open the code into an IDE by choice 
and make sure Python is installed into the device. After that, install all the libraries that are used
in the program, and this can be done by inputing the commands below on a command prompt:
"pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn"
or by the following commands below:
"pip install pandas"
"pip install numpy"
"pip install seaborn"
"pip install matplotlib"
"pip install scikit-learn"
After all the libraries are installed, run the program and the results will pop up.
